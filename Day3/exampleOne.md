# Part One Example

For example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:

`vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp`
`jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL`
`PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg`
`wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn`
`ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT`
`CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw`

The first rucksack contains the items `vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp`, which means its first compartment contains the items `vJrwpWtwJgWr`, while the second compartment contains the items `hcsFMMfFFhFp`. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase p.
The second rucksack's compartments contain `jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL` and `rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL`. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase L.
The third rucksack's compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the only common item type is uppercase P.
The fourth rucksack's compartments only share item type v.
The fifth rucksack's compartments only share item type t.
The sixth rucksack's compartments only share item type s.
To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:

Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.
In the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20 (t), and 19 (s); **the sum of these is 157**.
